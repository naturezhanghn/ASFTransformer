### Alternating Spatial-Frequency Transformer
Paper nameï¼šNeutralizing Atmospheric Turbulence in Optical Imaging through Alternating Spatial-Frequency Learning

Atmospheric turbulence is a complex phenomenon that poses challenges in optical imaging, particularly in applications like astronomy, remote sensing, and surveillance. The ASF-Transformer is designed to tackle this challenge head-on.

#### Key Features:
- **Learning Alternating in Spatial and Frequency Domains (LASF) Mechanism**: Inspired by the principles of split-step propagation and correlated imaging, ASF-Transformer includes the LASF mechanism, which alternately implements self-attention in both spatial and Fourier domains.
- **Enhanced Texture Recovery**: Assisted by Patch FFT loss, the ASF-Transformer can recover intricate textures without the need for generative adversarial schemes.
- **State-of-the-art Performance**: Evaluations across diverse test mediums show the model's superior performance compared to recent turbulence removal methods.

#### Benefits:
- **Novel Approach**: Unlike conventional GAN-based solutions, the ASF-Transformer opens a new pathway for handling real-world image degradations.
- **Insights into Neural Network Design**: By incorporating principles from optical theory, the ASF-Transformer not only provides a solution for turbulence mitigation but also offers potential insights for future neural network design.
